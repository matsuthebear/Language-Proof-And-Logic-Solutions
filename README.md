# LPL-Solutions

This repository contains all exercises and homeworks done during my first year at the University of Verona, for the "Logica" course. 
It does not have all the exercises, but only the ones i have done. 

Please, do not contact me for explanations or to upload more exercises, because I passed the exam a long time ago and I unfortunately do not remember the exact solutions. 


__Good luck with your course!__
