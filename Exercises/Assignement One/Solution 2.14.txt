Exercise 2.14

We are told that "b" is in between of "a" and "c", so
"a" is on the left of "b" and "c" is on the right of "b" or is the 
inverse, because "b" must be in the middle of those two objects. 
But as we are told, "a" is on the left of "c", we can tell that
"b" is on the left of "c". 
In conclusion we can tell that "a" is on the left of "b", because 
"b" is in between "a" and "c" and "c" is on the right of "b"
